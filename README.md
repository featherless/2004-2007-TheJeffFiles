# TheJeffFiles.com

> A chapter of featherless' [digital creative history](https://github.com/featherless/digital-creative-history).

TheJeffFiles.com was my personal portfolio for approximately three years. This site is where I'd host my code,
tutorials, and general news about the things I was up to.

In 2008 my credit card number changed and the domain name lapsed. It's now camped by a squatter and I've moved
over to JeffVerkoeyen.com.
