      Site Information
     </div><div class=content>
      TheJeffFiles.com was initially founded on January 10th, 2004, and went online on the 11th with the .com name.<br>
      After the site's basic design was layed out, it was then promptly redesigned with a much better, adaptable scheme
       that embraces the power of php and css.<p>
      <b>How to get around TheJeffFiles.com:</b><br>
       All games go in to the downloads area, and have their creators on the info file.  Also, each portfolio
               has files that that particular person made on their own or as part of a project (but not the whole thing).
               For example, Josh Rodasti's music in his portfolio is separate from the actual project so that you can
               listen to the music whenever you feel like without actually having to download the game.<p>
       You might notice that sometimes the site goes haywire and you might see debugging info at times, the reason
               for this is I am most likely updating the php code, so just come back to the site half an hour later, and
               the site should be back to normal.<p>

       The site has gone through many revisions in designs in the past year since it's been online, alas I only have images of
               the latest three designs.  Here are some small versions of them:<br><center>
