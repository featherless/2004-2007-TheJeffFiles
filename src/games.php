      <b>Gameplay</b>: The gameplay is very simple, 2D overhead tile-based movement.  For 72 hours of work the game itself is
       very complete, including 4 guild ranks, a giant world map, unlimited battling and leveling up, recruiting of
       pirates, and a final boss battle.  You use the arrow keys to move your pirate.  Board your pirate ship by stepping
       on a dock and moving towards your ship.<br>
       <blockquote><b><i>Battle System</i></b>: To enter a battle, move your pirate ship towards an enemy pirate ship until you collide
        with it.  Once you have done this, the battle GUI will pop up and you will need to click in the bottom right
        corner if you want to either attack or run.  Then, if you choose to attack, you will need to click the pirate
        who you want to attack (on the right).  Right away when you start the game you will end up just clicking
        repeatedly on the pirate, but later on when you recruit more men and have to fight bigger rosters, you will want
        to choose who you attack a bit wiser.</blockquote>
       <blockquote><b><i>Quest System</i></b>: To beat Adventurers and Outlaws, you must advance your ranks through the pirate's guild.  To
        get a quest from the guild, simply go there and ask for a quest.  You will be given a quest and when you finish
        the requirements for that quest, simply return and ask for a new quest: you will be given a possible reward and
        then you can get your actual quest.</blockquote>

      <b>Notes</b>: This game was created as part of the 72 Hour Game Development Competition (72hourGDC).  This was the team
       GameDev Guy's second entrance in to this competition.  The first competition's entry being RoboCafe.
       Throughout the competition, the team endured 20 hour days and on the last day, actually had to go to a basic
       weight training class for 2 hours, and rush back to finish the game in the last hour of time remaining.<p>

      <b>Competition Placement</b>:<br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp;1st place for <i>best sound</i> and <i>most complete</i>.<br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp;3rd place for <i>best gameplay</i>.<br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp;The game took 2nd place overall.

      <b>Gameplay</b>: Typical overhead asteroids game.  Arrow keys move and turn the ship, spacebar shoots, tab warps.
       There are also 2 menus that you can access, one is a secret menu with cheat codes on it.  To access the main menu
       just hit escape and you can enable music and go in to full screen.  To get the cheat code menu, press NumberPad 9 on
       your keyboard to bring up the cheat code menu.<p>

      <b>Notes</b>: This was the first game I ever created in OpenGL at the end of summer, 2002.

      <b>Gameplay</b>: Overhead 2D Real-Time Strategy game.  Created in the last week of school as a random side
       project while I was bored with the semester tests.  Game is complete with intro, menu, and working engine.  The gameplay,
       however, never got completely finished.  In the game itself you can select your units (the ones dropped off at
       shore) and tell them to move somewhere, shot at a certain enemy, or if their an APC, to drop off their load.  As
       the actual gameplay is still being developed, you can mess with the engine a bit.  To create more enemies, hit
       N and M on the keyboard and it will generate more infantry and tanks.  The only way to quit the game once you go
       in to the engine is to press alt-F4.<p>
                              
      <b>Notes</b>: This game is unfinished.

      <b>Gameplay</b>: This BSP engine was designed for what would have eventually become BloodRight3D, but ended
       up being more of a learning project for me than anything.  Included with the engine is a solid particle engine
       and a first person BSP engine.<br>
       The program starts in Particle Engine mode.  To change to BSP mode, hit F1.  To change back to Particle Engine
        mode, hit F2.<p>
       In Particle Engine mode the controls are as follows:<br>
       &nbsp;WASD: Move the camera in space<br>
       &nbsp;Mouse: Change camera direction<br>
       &nbsp;Space: Bullet Time<br>
       &nbsp;F1: Change to BSP mode<br>
       &nbsp;IJKL: Move the water fountain particle system<br>
       &nbsp;Arrow Keys: Move the smoke particle system<p>
       In BSP mode the controls are as follows:<br>
       &nbsp;WASD: Move the camera<br>
       &nbsp;Mouse: Change camera direction<br>
       &nbsp;Space: Jump<br>
       &nbsp;Collide with doors to open them, stand on elevators to go up them<p>
                              
      <b>Notes</b>: This is merely an engine, but could possibly be worked in to a game.

      <b>Gameplay</b>: Escape From the Funky Factory was designed by the now non-existent The Developer's Alliance(TDA).  It
       was the first project for the team and turned out very well.  We started TDA as a result of meeting each other
       from the National Youth Leadership Forum on Technology (NYLFTech) and presented EFFF at a seminar that we gave
       at the forum.  The game is complete with 20 levels, a level editor, a level editor tutorial, and custom playlist
       features.<br>
       <i>To use the custom playlist, merely place your own mp3 files inside the <b>Music</b> folder where you installed
        EFFF at.</i>

      <b>Gameplay</b>: This is a remake of the game Final Fantasy I by SquareSoft.  Many thanks go out to Brian Carper
       for providing an awesome site at <a href="http://www.planetnintendo.com/ff1/">www.planetnintendo.com/ff1/</a>.
       A lot of thought went in to making the engine for this remake.<br>
       The world map was pieced together by getting an emulator, editing the rom file and making the airship invisible,
       and then moving through every single tile on the map, one screen at a time and taking screenshots.  Then each of
       these screenshots was placed in a giant bmp file that contained the entire map.  The end result of the world map
       ended up being a 4080x4096 bmp file.<br>
       After the bmp was made of the worldmap, I created a separate program that scanned the bmp file and found each
       unique tile, and placed them in to a separate tileset bitmap, and also pieced together a .map file which pointed
       to each tile that was at that position.  Believe it or not but the worldmap's tileset only contains 236 unique
       tiles.  This same process was repeated for the Corneria town map and worked superbly.<p>
       The controls are as follows (following the NES control scheme):<br>
       &nbsp;Arrow Keys: arrows on the dpad<br>
       &nbsp;X: A<br>
       &nbsp;Z: B<br>
       &nbsp;Enter: Start<br>
       &nbsp;Space: Select<p>
                              
      <b>Notes</b>: This game isn't complete.  You can start a new game, visit Corneria, change the order of your
       characters, talk to people in the town, and enter the start menu and all sub-menus.  The battle system is not
       incorporated.

       you can press space to shoot lasers and shoot at the ships flying at the top of the screen.  There is also
       a cheat code to select levels by pressing F2 and then the number of the level to jump to (either 1 or 2).<p>

      <b>Gameplay</b>: JetPack Jack was the first big project I worked on once I learned OpenGL.  The game's idea
       was born in a barber shop when I was getting my hair cut, and when we got back we started working on the game
       right away.  By the end of that weekend we had the engine working so you could jump around with Jack and move
       across the paralaxing level.  The game itself isn't very well optimized and isn't frame limited at all, so it
       will either run too fast or too slow, or if you're lucky will run just as intended.  To play JetPack Jack,
       press the left and right arrow keys to move left and right, up to jump in the air, and spacebar to shoot your
       missiles.<p>                                           
                              
      <b>Notes</b>: This was the first full OpenGL game that I ever created.  Included with it is completely hand-drawn
       art by Josh Rodasti along with all of the music composed by him.<br>

      <b>Gameplay</b>: PongFX is game #1 of the FXSeries.  Gameplay follows that of normal pong, but with an extra
       slab of 3D gfx in there.  The game modes include Classic, Arcade, Custom, and even a 2 Player Network version.
       Classic starts off with 2 balls, and no items in the game, Arcade starts off with 3 balls and includes items,
       Custom allows you to customize the game however you want, and the 2 Player Network allows you to connect to
       another computer on the local area network and play against them (still a bit buggy, but it works for the most
       part).<p>

      <b>Gameplay</b>: RoboCafe is by far the most addicting game I've ever made.  It includes 2 levels in the actual
       gameplay, along with a minigames section, instructions, and full credits.  This was our first entry in to the
       72 hour Game development Competition and we're happy with the results of the game.  With a catchy soundtrack,
       addictive gameplay, and replayability brought in by the minigames section, this is one of the most complete games
       I've made.<p>

      <b>Gameplay</b>: Roidian: Final Hour is your standard overhead flying shooter game.  The game is set in multiple
       settings, including forests, cities, and space.  Arrow keys move your ship, while spacebar shoots (rapid fire).
       In the later levels of the game you can press Tab to slow time down and kill the enemies a lot quicker.  There
       is somewhat of a plot in the game if you care to actually read the mission briefings.<p>
